% NAME OF ACADEMIC UNIT
%
% The following two commands allow you to specify the academic unit you belong to.
% This will appear on the title page as
% ``<academic unit> of <department>''.
% So if you are in the division of biomedical engineering you would need to do:
% \department{Biomedical Engineering}
% \academicunit{Division}
%
% The default is ``Department of Computer Science'' if these commands
% are not given.
%
% If you are in a discipline other than Computer Science, uncomment the following line and
% specify your discipline/department.  Default is 'Computer Science'.
% \department{If not Computer Science, put the name of your department here}

% If you are not in a department, but say, a division, uncomment the following line.
% \academicunit{Put the type of academic unit you belong to here, e.g. Division, College}


% PERMISSION TO USE ADDRESS
%
% If you are not in Compuer Science you will want to change the
% address on the Permission to Use page.  This is done using the
% \ptuaddress{}.  Example:
%
% \ptuaddress{Head of the Department of Computer Science\\
% 176 Thorvaldson Building\\
% 110 Science Place\\
% University of Saskatchewan\\
% Saskatoon, Saskatchewan\\
% Canada\\

% ABSTRACT
\abstract{The number of mobile devices is growing very fast. Smart phones and tablets are, step by step, replacing desktops and laptops as the primary method of computing in daily life. Along with the rapid evolution of mobile devices, the applications on them are undergoing fast transformation. We can see many improvements in traditional applications (messaging, calling, etc.) like multimedia text messages, video calls, voice over IP and so forth. However, the Contacts application has not changed much while it has many potentials. In this thesis, we propose a new model which improves the Contacts application by introducing three novel capabilities: searching for contacts by their miscellaneous information, retaining knowledge of contacts via a tags system, and establishing a \textit{Personal Social Network} which consists of the relationships between the contacts. By introducing these capabilities, the model helps its users to accomplish new tasks which are not currently handled by modern Contacts applications. Furthermore, the model is implemented and become a fully functional prototype on iOS and Android. The prototype is then evaluated in a user study and a system performance test. The studies yield positive results which indicate that the three new capabilities are valuable and should be included in today's Contacts applications.}

% In this thesis, we explore the potentials of providing custom information, retaining historical context data in the Contacts application and connecting the contacts together based on their relationships. We implement a prototype of the new Contacts application which utilizes these three aspects then test it among a group of users. Our results are expected to indicate that custom information, historical context data and contact relationships are three important parts which should be included in today's Contacts applications.

% According to the 2014 annual report from Cisco \cite{cisco_report}, there were 406 million new smart phones and 92 million new tablets activated in 2013. Not only are smart devices increasing in popularity but they are becoming more and more powerful. The latest A8X chip which Apple uses for the iPad Air 2 contains 3 billion transistors and has 40\% more CPU performance and 2.5 times the graphics performance of its predecessor - the Apple A7 which had been released just a year before.
