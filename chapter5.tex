\chapter{Summary and Future Work}
This study proposes a new approach to the Contacts application. By introducing new types of information in combination with capturing social data, the new Contacts application provides users a better way of managing their contacts. Furthermore, the study presents a novel internal network of relationships among contacts which helps users explore the contacts space as a whole - a task which is still impossible for the Contacts application nowadays.

%Although the experiment still has limitations, it has shown that our approach has significantly improved the Contacts application. Our future work will focus on carrying out large scale, comprehensive experiments together with exploiting more potentials of the new Contacts application such as relationships recommendation, contextual searching.
